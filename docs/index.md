# PrototAPI

The aim of this repository is to test complex patterns in FastAPI, while showing best practices that I'm learning with respect to:

- coding patterns
- advanced python libraries
- repository packaging and distribution
- CI/CD
- documentation

## Future development

My plan is to gradually add more complex examples and use-cases, possibly with some data science & machine learning applications.

In the future, I would like to use this repository to move the first steps in front-end development, too.
